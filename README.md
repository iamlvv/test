# README
This project contains 2 main folders: client and server.
## STRUCTURE OF PROJECT
First, cd to folder server and run command line: ```npm start``` to start the server at localhost 3001.
After that, cd out and cd to the folder client and run command line: ```npm start``` to start the frontend.
## TECHNOLOGY
This project implements both server side and client side. 
In terms of client side, I use ReactJS and a CSS framework - Tailwind CSS to design the user interface, Axios - a HTTP Client library to call API, Sweetalert2 - a library for popup windows. In the mean time, in server side, I use ExpressJS - a backend framework, Twilio to implement sending SMS function, Realtime Firebase as Database. I also store Environment Variables in .env file for security.
## HOW TO USE
This is the homepage of the project.

As you can see in the image above, there are 2 input fields, the first one is where you type your phone number (in this case it is my phone number: 0971144787 - string type). By default, the second input field is disabled until your phone number is checked by system. However, at this time, there is a problem with button Submit phone number. It is that it only works smoothly from the second click. This is something I have to consider strictly if I have more time and I have a chance to go with you further.

As you can see in the image above, the system has checked your phone number and found it in the database, the access code is then sent to your phone number; meanwhile, the second input field is enabled so that you can type the access code you have received recently.

As you can see in the image above, this is the message from Twilio containing the access code.

As you can see from the two images above, your access code has been accepted and a success popup shows up.
In case you type wrong access code, the failure popup shows up like this below.
